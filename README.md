Customer Telco Churn Prediction using Classification Algorithm (Machine Learning-Supervised)

In this use case, I want to predict that telco industry customers will churn or not use supervised data and algorithms. The challenges of this use case and data is that the target variable has an unbalanced composition and each variable has a poor correlation with the target variable.

I'm using CRISP-DM as a framework. Exploration Data Analysis (EDA) is included in the Data Understanding stage, and for data preparation I conducted sampling (undersampling and SMOTE). I used three models and hyperparameter settings for model and hyperparameter selection. And lastly, I find out the importance of features.
